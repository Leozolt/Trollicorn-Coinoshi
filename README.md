The Unicorn troll coin uses a special consensus mechanism using 3 native tokens to balance the consensus mint protocol and the ecosystem.
UNICOIN, TROLL, CORN are minted equally* to UTC*2 and CORN is collaterized to nodes named "Unicorns"
that then burn TROLL, and mint UNICOIN. A more detailed description oft the mechanism will probably never get posted.
